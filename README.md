# Homework - Midi Generator using LSTM
Homework of Knowledge Discovery Course

The aim of this homework is to understand and build a LSTM model using PyTorch that takes as dataset music styles and generates a playable ABC sequence.
The dataset contains: dance, pop and rock MIDI files taken from [MIDIWorld](https://www.midiworld.com/), [CPrato](https://www.cprato.com/) and [FreeMIDI](https://freemidi.org/).

# Run
You can run the code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8cktGfpahbgwdNaQKPjxfxNj01RzB21?usp=sharing)
